# Mountain Growl

## What's this?

So you've installed Mountain Lion with the all new [Notification Center](http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/#notification-center). Good for you!  
But what's this? All those old [Growl](http://growl.info) notifications mixed with the shiny and new. Doesn't seem right, eh?

Enter _Mountain Growl_:

Other solutions like [Hiss](http://collect3.com.au/hissapp/) are okay, but a actually a weird hack with a lot of down sides. So while waiting for Growl 2 (which hopefully will support the Notification Center) why not use the current Growl with a plugin that does the necessary. All as a 1st class citizen in Growl.


## Installation

- I'm assuming you've already have Growl (version 1.4 required) installed. If not you can get it from the [App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/growl/id467939042?mt=12).
- Go & download the latest version of Mountain Growl from the [GitHub download page](https://github.com/stigi/MountainGrowl/downloads).
- Double click it & Growl should take the install process from there.
- Make sure to select MountainGrowl as your default style in the Growl display settings.


## Downsides

All the notifications are still sent by Growl, so they all show the Growl icon. I'm curious how Growl 2 will target that [issue](https://github.com/stigi/MountainGrowl/issues/1). Mountain Growl is showing the original application name in the subtitle though.


## Upsides

The standard Growl click actions also work.


## TODOs

- Add an option to switch title with subtitle
- Create a proper website (is this actually needed?)
- Collecting high fives
